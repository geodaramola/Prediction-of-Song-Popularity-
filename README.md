Predicting Song Popularity with Engineered Audio Features

📌 Project Overview

Bassline.io is exploring whether its existing engineered audio features can effectively predict the popularity of a song. This project evaluates the usefulness of those features by building and interpreting a machine learning model to predict song popularity.

The goal is not to deploy a production-ready model, but rather to assess:

- Whether the current feature set has predictive value

- Which features contribute most to song popularity

- What limitations exist in the current feature engineering approach

🧠 Business Problem

The data science team at Bassline.io has previously engineered several audio-related features, including:

- Danceability

- Energy

- Acousticness

Before investing further effort into feature development, the team wants to understand:

- Are these features actually useful for predicting song popularity?

To answer this, we frame the task as a supervised regression problem where song popularity is predicted using the existing engineered features.

🎯 Objectives

Build a machine learning model to predict song popularity

- Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- Interpret model results to determine feature usefulness

- Identify limitations of the current feature set

- Provide insights to guide future feature engineering efforts


Target variable: song_popularity
